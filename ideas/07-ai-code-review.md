# AI Code Review & Documentation Generator

## Overview
An AI tool that automatically reviews code, suggests improvements, detects bugs, and generates documentation. Integrates with GitHub/GitLab as a PR reviewer.

## Market Opportunity
- **Market Size**: Developer tools market $50B+, code quality tools $5B
- **Problem**: Code reviews take 3-5 hours/week, inconsistent quality
- **Trend**: 84% of developers say AI will improve code review process

## Key Features
1. **Automated PR Reviews**: AI comments on pull requests
2. **Bug Detection**: Find security vulnerabilities, logic errors
3. **Performance Suggestions**: Optimize slow code
4. **Documentation Generation**: Auto-generate docstrings, README
5. **Coding Standards**: Enforce team style guides
6. **Learning Mode**: Explains why changes are needed

## Revenue Model
- **Open Source**: Free for public repos
- **Team**: $20/developer/month
- **Enterprise**: $50/developer/month + custom training

**Path to $100K MRR**: 5,000 developers @ $20 = $100K

## Competitive Advantages vs. GitHub Copilot/CodeRabbit
- Focused on code quality, not generation
- Team-specific learning (adapts to your codebase)
- Security-first (OWASP Top 10 detection)

## Timeline to $100K MRR: 10-12 months

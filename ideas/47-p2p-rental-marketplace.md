## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Seed Market (Months 1-3)
- Launch in ONE city (Austin, Denver, Portland - eco-conscious)
- Recruit 100 listers (tools, cameras, gear)
- Free rentals for first month (build supply)
- Target: 500 rentals

### Phase 2: Growth (Months 4-8)
- Paid marketing: Facebook/Instagram local ads
- Partnerships: REI, Home Depot (list their rental inventory)
- Content: "How I made $500/month renting my tools"
- Target: 5,000 rentals/month

### Phase 3: Expansion (Months 9-18)
- Expand to 5 cities
- Focus on density over geographic spread
- Corporate partnerships (insurance, tools brands)
- Target: 25,000 rentals/month

## Key Metrics to Track
1. **Active Listers** (supply)
2. **Monthly Rentals** (demand)
3. **Average Rental Value** (GMV)
4. **Take Rate** (commission %)
5. **Utilization Rate** (% of items rented)
6. **Retention** (repeat renters)
7. **Dispute Rate** (damage, theft)

## Financial Projections

### Year 1
- 10,000 rentals @ $50 average = $500K GMV
- 17% take rate = $85K revenue
- Expenses: $200K (engineering, ops, insurance)
- Net: -$115K (investment phase)

### Year 2
- 100,000 rentals @ $60 average = $6M GMV
- 17% = $1M revenue
- Expenses: $600K
- Net: $400K (breakeven+)

## Why This Will Succeed (or Fail)

### Success Factors
✓ Proven model (Turo, Airbnb work)
✓ Sustainability trend (reduce consumption)
✓ Economic benefit (earn + save money)
✓ Community building (neighbor connections)

### Risks
✗ Trust/safety concerns
✗ Low transaction values (hard to monetize)
✗ High customer acquisition costs
✗ Legal/insurance complexity

## Regulatory Considerations
- Liability insurance requirements
- Local rental regulations
- Tax implications for renters
- Zoning laws (commercial vs. personal)

## Next Steps
1. Choose pilot city (prioritize density potential)
2. Recruit 50 power listers
3. Build MVP (listings, search, bookings, payments)
4. Soft launch with free rentals
5. Measure utilization and engagement
6. Iterate based on feedback
7. Scale marketing based on unit economics

## Estimated Timeline to $100K MRR
**20-24 months** with focused execution and city-by-city expansion

**Critical Success Factor**: Achieving density in each city before expanding to next

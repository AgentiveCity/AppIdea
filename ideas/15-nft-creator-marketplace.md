## Market Opportunity
- **Market Size**: NFT market $3.5B (2024), growing with mainstream adoption
- **Problem**: OpenSea is complex, gas fees are high, UX is poor
- **Opportunity**: Make NFTs accessible to non-crypto creators

## Key Features
1. **Easy Minting**: Drag-drop file, mint NFT (no crypto knowledge)
2. **Low Fees**: Layer 2 solution (Polygon) for cheap minting ($1 vs. $50)
3. **Fiat Payments**: Buy with credit card, not just crypto
4. **Royalties**: Automatic creator royalties on resales (10%)
5. **Collections**: Organize NFTs into series
6. **Social Features**: Follow creators, comment, like

## Revenue Model
- **Transaction Fee**: 2.5% on all sales
- **Minting Fee**: $1 per NFT minted

## Competitive Advantages vs. OpenSea
- **Creator-Focused**: Not for traders/speculators
- **Fiat Payments**: Credit card accepted
- **Lower Fees**: 2.5% vs. OpenSea's fluctuating fees
